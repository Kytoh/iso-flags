=============

You can view all the flags here: http://hjnilsson.github.io/country-flags/

This repository contains renders of all the worlds flags in SVG and PNG format.

The source files were taken from Wikipedia and are not under copyright
protection since flags are effectively in public domain (there may be other
restrictions on how the flag can be used though).

The flags are named by their 2-letter ISO-3166 country code, except for the
constituent countries of Great Britain which have 6-letter codes "GB-ENG" etc).

Kosovo uses the user-assigned country code `XK`, which is not part of the ISO standard, but in use by several multinational organizations.

Also included is a JSON file that maps the ISO country code to the name of the
country.
